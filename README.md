### Adaptive-Cruise-Control
This is the fianl project 2020 Winter in EECS 461 class at Umich 

The goal of the project is to simulate Auto steering and Adaptive Cruise 
Control. In this project, I implemented a virtual car system on NXP S32K144
board to build the connections between the microprocessor and the haptic 
wheel. Then, I implemented the whole embedded system by generating C 
code from a Simulink model, and interact with othersâ€™ system via control area 
network (CAN). In the end, I built ACC by a simple algorithm with a state flow
chart, and auto steering control by designing two PD controllers.
